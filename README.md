## How to Run

1. Implement functions in the `utils/` directory based on your chosen APIs.

2. Install dependencies and run the program:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```

3. To run the application server:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. If you change the data in the `data/` directory or the `meta.csv` file, ensure you run the offline processing script to generate the index and metadata:

    ```bash
    python offline_processing.py
    ```
